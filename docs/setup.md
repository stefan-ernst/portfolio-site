After installation, Denkplan Portfolio Map for Jira will be available in 
all Jira projects (all Project types are supported).

You can choose to limit this by going to the global configuration: Manage Apps - Portfolio Map for Jira.

Here you can select which projects to enable the portfolio mapping functionality.

Even if you only select to enable it in one project - you can include issues
from all over Jira in the portfolio map.
